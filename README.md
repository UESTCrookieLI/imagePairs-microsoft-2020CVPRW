It is very excited that i meet someone like you who haved read this paper too.
I have a doubt that why the color of HR and LR in this paper are different.



I can not use this dataset to train a good deep learning network due to the color is different in HR and LR.

someone said it is because of Polarization of light, but I do not think so.(I know there is Neutral beam splitter that will not change the color)

Do you have some thought solve my problem?

If you reply me, i will very gald.

Look forward to you reply!
